        <h2>Development overview</h2>
        <div class="row d-flex">
          <div class="col-md-8">
            <p>I joined the project at the very start of the preproduction phase, shortly after the initial pitches and
              concept
              prototypes. I continued contributing throughout the development process, staying involved until the final
              stages of polishing and debugging before transitioning to new projects.</p>
            <p>I served as Senior Gameplay Programmer for the majority of the project, contributing to the initial game
              architecture. Over time, I specialized in and took primary responsibility for the 3Cs: Character,
              Controller,
              and Camera.</p>
            <p>During this period, I worked closely with game designers and animators to bring Nunu and Willump to life.
            </p>
            <p>I have played a key role in developing most of the character behaviors and controls, from
              basic
              movement and state management to unique character-specific mechanics, such as snowball throwing, magic ice
              manipulation, and the flute</p>
            <p>Another key area I led development on was the camera system, which was crucial due to the project's
              narrative-driven nature and the variety of unique situations requiring specialized camera behaviors. We
              created a robust, dynamic system that seamlessly adapts to gameplay without distracting the player,
              maintaining a high-quality standard throughout. Notable features include smooth cinematic-to-gameplay
              transitions, automatic camera behaviors (like obstacle avoidance), and almost imperceptible transitions
              between camera shots during gameplay.</p>

            <p>In addition to the 3Cs, I developed several standalone systems and features across various parts of the
              game,
              including the puzzle system, pendulums, blastcones, and the Biggest Snowball Ever minigame (including its
              Final Boss phase). This broad involvement gave me a comprehensive understanding of the project and its
              underlying systems, making me a key resource for colleagues across different disciplines when solving
              complex
              issues that spanned multiple game systems.</p>

        <p>As a Senior Gameplay Programmer, I delivered robust, reliable systems and implementations that required
          minimal maintenance over time, were well-documented, performed efficiently, and met design requirements. I
          frequently coordinated with designers and artists to ensure the implementation was future-proof and
          seamlessly
          integrated into the game. Additionally, I provided support whenever unexpected issues arose from the
          interaction of game systems during development.</p>
        <p>As the game neared completion, a development expansion was initiated to increase its quality and content.
          At
          this point, I transitioned into the role of Game Designer, where I was responsible for redesigning
          problematic
          features and creating new content that elevated the game's overall quality. Key contributions include the
          climbing system, the Volibear boss fight, and expanding puzzle variety. Additionally, I worked on broader
          tasks such as updating documentation, fine-tuning camera parameters, and addressing gameplay issues.</p>

        <h2>Crafting Volibear's Boss Fight</h2>

        <h3>Specifications, Requirements, and Initial Analysis</h3>

        <p>The initial specifications and requirements I was given for this design include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Volibear's Overwhelming Power</strong>: The player cannot defeat Volibear directly, emphasizing
            his immense strength.</li>
          <li><strong>Showcasing Volibear's Scale</strong>: It's essential to convey the true size and power of Volibear
            within the fight.</li>
          <li><strong>Leveraging Volibear's Signature Abilities</strong>: The boss fight must integrate Volibear's
            iconic abilities, ensuring they play a key role in the encounter.</li>
          <li><strong>Short Duration</strong>: The fight should be brief, aiming for a duration of around 90 seconds.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Survival Challenge</strong>: Players must survive for a set period before triggering a cinematic
            sequence where Volibear is struck by a boulder (this sequence is pre-planned).
          </li>
          <li><strong>Fixed Arena</strong>: Due to budget constraints (animation and AI), the arena is fixed around
            Volibear, and he remains stationary during the encounter.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Gameplay-wise, the budget for this fight was very limited, and the core gameplay logic needed to be developed
          within one to
          two months by a gameplay programmer and myself. Once the core systems were in place, art assets were
          integrated, and I provided ongoing maintenance as everything came together, while also handling other design
          tasks.</p>

          <div class="card-body">
            <p class="card-text">We wanted to convey Volibear's epic size and rage</p>
          </div>

            <div class="modal-content border-0">
              <div class="modal-body p-0">
                <button type="button" class="btn-close position-absolute top-0 end-0 m-2" data-bs-dismiss="modal"

              </div>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>With these specifications in mind, we focused on the following ideas:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Dynamic Camera Shots</strong>: Utilize the fixed arena to introduce dynamic camera angles that
            enhance the cinematic feel of the fight.</li>
          <li><strong>Volibear's Frenzied Nature</strong>: Volibear should feel relentless and savage, overwhelming the
            player with a continuous barrage of powerful attacks.</li>
          <li><strong>Boss Moveset</strong>: Design a budget-conscious moveset that forces the player to keep moving and
            dodging,
            maintaining constant engagement.</li>
          <li><strong>Clear Progression</strong>: The fight ends when the player breaks exposed blastcones after a
            certain period. Progression throughout the fight should be clear and intuitive.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Arena Design</h3>

        <p>When designing the arena, I had a few key restrictions to consider:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Volibear's movement was fixed. This decision helped us stay within our AI and animation budget, especially
            given Volibear's size, which is much larger than any other AI driven NPC in the game.</li>
          <li>The blastcones, which signal the end of the fight, needed to remain visible as much as possible.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>After considering these constraints, I determined that the arena should be a semicircle around Volibear. This
          design allowed Volibear to rotate in place, ensuring he could reach all areas of the arena. Given his large
          size, this layout still provided ample space for a dynamic fight.</p>

        <p>The size of the arena went through several iterations to find a balance between providing enough space and
          ensuring the blastcones were visible at all times, without Volibear obstructing the view.</p>

        <p>For the arena's width, the goal was to give enough space for players to avoid some of Volibear's attacks by
          moving in any direction, not just left and right, all while keeping the area manageable for the camera. The final size was roughly the same as Willump's jump
          distance, avoiding any sense of confinement and allowing Volibear to still reach all corners of the arena.</p>

        <h3>Volibear moveset</h3>
        <p>We aimed to design Volibear's moveset to be reminiscent of his abilities in League of Legends, ensuring that
          fans of the character would recognize them and be more engaged with the fight.</p>

        <h4>Side Swipe</h4>

        <div class="row d-flex align-items-center">

          <div class="col-md-7">
            <p>A powerful lateral swipe that leverages Volibear's size, covering about half of the arena. This forces
              the
              player to move around, helping them reposition toward the center of the arena—where there is more space to
              dodge other attacks, enhancing the overall flow and enjoyment of the fight.</p>

            <p>While designing this attack, several key considerations were made to enhance its readability and game
              feel,
              including:</p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-md-5">
            <video src="assets/songofnunu/sideswipe.mp4" controls autoplay muted loop
              class="img-fluid d-block p-1 pb-3 mx-auto"></video>
          </div>
        </div>
        <ul>
          <li>Players should have enough time to escape the attack, even if they're at the very edge of the arena. To
            ensure this, the charge time for Volibear's attack is variable, depending on how far from the center the
            player is when it triggers.</li>
          <li>The impact area must be clearly defined while Volibear charges the attack, as this is when the player
            needs to recognize and avoid it. To aid in this, a custom decal was added to mark the area on the ground.
          </li>
          <li>The animation pose should be easily recognizable and distinct from Volibear's other attacks.</li>
          <li>If the player quickly escapes the attack, Volibear can't remain idle, charging the attack without action,
            as it would undermine his savage nature. If the player moves out of the attack's range, it will immediately
            trigger.</li>
        </ul>

          <div class="col-md-7">
            <p>Volibear swipes down towards the player's position. To add variety to his moveset, this attack tracks the
              player and requires precise dodging to avoid being hit.</p>

            <p>While designing this attack, several key considerations were made to enhance its readability and game
              feel,
              including:</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <ul>
          <li>The animation pose should be easily recognizable and distinct from Volibear's other attacks. This was
            especially important for this move, as we don't use a red zone to indicate its impact. Players must rely
            on
            Volibear's animation to time their dodges correctly.</li>
          <li>Dodging the attack should feel natural. We created custom animation events to establish time windows
            within the animation, allowing the attack to stop tracking if the player dodges or jumps away, resulting
            in
            the attack missing.</li>
          <li>Dialog lines were especially important for this attack, as they provided hints on the right moment to
            dodge.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Sky splitter</h4>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-md-6">
            <p>Volibear summons lightning from the skies, creating a distinct phase in the combat where the player must
              focus on avoiding a series of lightning patterns, shifting their attention away from Volibear himself.</p>
            <p>This move can be seen as a progression of a mechanic previously introduced by the elementals. It also
              ties in
              nicely with one of the phases of the final boss fight. However, to highlight Volibear's personality in
              contrast to Lissandra's, while Lissandra's version is more precise and deliberate, Volibear's is erratic,
              fast, and
              brutal.</p>

        <p>While designing this attack, several key considerations were made to enhance its readability and game feel,
          including:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The lightning patterns needed to be varied and feel organic. To achieve this, I developed a small tool
            that generated a wide range of patterns with some randomness, including slight size variations and timing
            offsets.</li>
          <li>Among the different patterns, some were designed to force the player to move from their current position,
            while others anticipated the player's movement. This required the player to pay attention to incoming
            patterns, as not all could be avoided in the same way.</li>
          <li>To further increase variety and provide a powerful finish to the attack, a new phase was introduced where
            the entire arena is covered in lightning, and the player must quickly find a safe spot to stand.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>To achieve this, the arena was divided into segments, each with different lightning patterns. These
                patterns could be of two types: 'Heavy patterns,' which cover almost the entire section, and 'Light
                patterns,' which leave more open space.</li>
              <li>To ensure the attack always feels fair, we detected the player's current segment and guaranteed that
                at least one neighboring segment would feature a light pattern, while the others would be covered by
                heavy patterns.</li>
              <li>The timing of the attack and the patterns were carefully tuned, creating situations where players
                might need to take a risk and find a safe zone within a heavy pattern, rather than always relying on the
                light pattern.</li>
            </ul>

        <h4>The Relentless Storm</h4>
        <div class="card d-block mx-auto w-66">

          </div>
        </div>
        <p>In League of Legends, Volibear empowers his auto-attacks with lightning. We aimed to convey this by adding a
          lightning-empowered version of his regular swipe attacks. To keep within budget, we repurposed the Sky
          Splitter lightning tool to add lightning patterns to these attacks, significantly reducing development time.
        </p>
        <p>As these attacks are more challenging to avoid, Volibear can only use them after the first Sky Splitter,
          providing a sense of progression and increasing the intensity of the fight.</p>


        <h4>Thundering Smash</h4>
        <div class="card d-block mx-auto w-66">

            class="img-fluid d-block pt-3 mx-auto"></video>
          <div class="card-body">
            <p class="card-text">The camera subtly looks towards the blastcones after Thundering Smash</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>To progress the fight and give the player access to the blastcones that end it, we introduced Thundering
          Smash. Volibear slams the ground with such force that the entire arena shakes, breaking the ice that traps the
          blastcones, allowing the player to progress towards the fight's conclusion.</p>
        <p>Volibear can only use this attack after reaching specific time thresholds, which allowed us to control the
          fight's overall duration. While it's a cinematic and powerful-looking attack, it's relatively easy to avoid.
          The 'off-time' provided ensures that players can properly read the situation and track the fight's
          progression.</p>


        <h4>Stormbringer</h4>
        <p>Stormbringer is Volibear's ultimate ability, where he physically transforms, becoming enveloped in lightning.
        </p>
        <p>While the concept of Stormbringer was interesting, it was discarded early on due to being out of scope for
          the art team, and the fight duration wouldn't have been long enough for it to feel meaningful.</p>


        <h4>Laughs and Roars</h4>
        <div class="card d-block mx-auto w-66">

          </div>
        </div>
        <p>To convey Volibear's personality and emphasize that he cannot be damaged, he would laugh or roar during the
          fight, particularly when the player manages to land a hit on him.</p>

        <p>One of the main goals for this boss fight was to make it feel spectacular, showcasing Volibear's power and
          scale. Drawing from my previous knowledge of the game's camera systems, I focused on dynamically adjusting
          camera properties to enhance the cinematic feel of the fight and improve the readability of the attacks. I
          began working on camera system improvements to allow dynamic changes based on Volibear's attacks. Some of the
          key outcomes of this work include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The base camera shot is positioned low to the ground to emphasize Volibear's scale, while still
            maintaining enough visibility of the ground to allow the player to move comfortably throughout the fight.
          </li>
          <li>The camera frequently shifts to focus on different parts of Volibear's body, improving the readability of
            his attacks.</li>
          <li>The camera zooms in as Volibear charges the side swipe, helping convey the timing and giving players a
            better sense of how much time they have to avoid it.</li>
          <li>The camera shifts to a more top-down view during Sky Splitter, enhancing the readability of that phase of
            the fight while maintaining the cinematic feel of the rest of the combat.</li>
          <li>During thundering smash there is a quite dramatic shift of perspective, particulary for the FOV, to be
            able to show Volibear while he is jumping and increase the feeling of power of the attacks.</li>
          <li>The camera subtly shifts towards the blastcones in the background after each Thundering Smash, providing a
            subtle hint to the player on how to progress the fight.</li>
          <li>All camera changes were carefully tweaked and balanced to prevent motion sickness.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Balance and Fight Readability</h3>

        <p>From the outset, the design was intentionally made to be highly configurable, allowing us to fine-tune
          various elements later on for optimal difficulty. For example, we could adjust:</p>

        <div class="container">
          <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-6">
              <ul>
                <li>Attack speed</li>
                <li>Damage</li>
                <li>Animation anticipation time</li>
                <li>Available movement pool in each phase</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-6">
              <ul>
                <li>Likelihood of specific attacks in succession</li>
                <li>Time between attacks</li>
                <li>Specific attack moves cooldowns</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>Thanks to this flexibility, balancing the fight was a straightforward process.</p>

        <p>Another key focus was fight readability. Since Volibear's attacks could overwhelm the player, it was crucial
          to ensure they could quickly understand the situation and know how to respond.</p>

        <p>To help with this, most attacks featured clear red decals indicating where they would land—this is a feature
          introduced by other enemies in the game. However, for Volibear's Downward Claw Attack, which tracks the
          player, I opted not to use red decals. While this was initially a concern, I believed the move would add
          variety to the combat. After careful adjustments to the animation, camera positioning, and timing of warning
          voice lines, playtesters were able to avoid the attack without difficulty and found the fight more engaging.

        <p>Another major consideration was signaling when the player could interact with the blastcones to end the
          fight. We decided on an ice wall containing the blastcones, which would shatter after major Volibear attacks.
          The ice wall was transparent, allowing players to see the blastcones from the start of the fight. As the ice
          broke, it served as a clear indicator of the fight's progress.</p>

        <p>We tweaked Thundering Smash to be easily avoidable, with an extended follow-through phase. This provided the
          player with plenty of time to notice the ice wall breaking, further supported by camera work and voice lines
          to guide them.</p>

        <p>While the design worked in the end, ideally, the ice breaking would have been more visually noticeable, with
          chunks of ice falling to alter the silhouette of the wall. However, due to technical limitations, this wasn't
          possible. Despite this, the other elements in place ensured the fight remained clear and understandable for
          players.</p>



        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>The development of the Volibear boss fight was a smooth and efficient process, thanks to the early direction
          and clear understanding of the game's underlying systems. As both the main Game Designer and Gameplay
          Programmer, I was able to prototype and implement the various fight components quickly, allowing for seamless
          integration. By incorporating flexible configuration options from the start, we were able to fine-tune the
          difficulty to ensure a balanced and engaging experience.</p>
        <p>Constant communication with the programming, animation, and VFX teams helped ensure that all aspects of the
          fight came together smoothly, keeping the development on track and within the allocated budget. The fast
          development timeline did not hinder the quality of the implementation, and the results were highly
          satisfactory. Despite the tight schedule, the feature required minimal maintenance after its delivery.</p>

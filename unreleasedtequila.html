        <h2>Development overview</h2>
        <p class="text-center m-5"><em><strong>Note:</strong> This game is currently under NDA, so I won't be able to
            discuss specific details about
            my work that reveal what the game is actually like.</em></p>

        <p>As a direct translation from publicly available information provided by Tequila Works:</p>
        <p><strong><em></em>
            "The Ancient Mariner is an open-world narrative action adventure developed by Tequila Works, focused on
            human
            emotions as the driving force of gameplay.</br>With an introspective approach, the player must reconnect
            with
            their childhood and learn to understand and channel complex emotions in order to progress.</br>The game
            relies on
            a systematic emotional system, free exploration, and artistic direction with strong symbolic elements."

        </p>

        <p>I began working on this project from its very early concept phase and continued until production was halted.
          Throughout the development process, I transitioned between various roles as the organization adapted to
          different phases of development.</p>
        <p>Following a brief conceptual prototype phase as the <strong>Technical Lead</strong>, I transitioned into the
          dual roles of <strong>Game Designer</strong> and <strong>Product Owner</strong>
          for the majority of the development process.</p>

        <h3>Conceptual Prototypes phase: Technical Lead</h3>

        <p>I began working during the conceptual phase as the lead on the technical aspects of gameplay, with support
          from
          the programming lead, who was primarily focused on wrapping up other projects at the time.</p>

        <p>My initial priority was to define the project's architecture, guided by these key principles:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Flexibility to allow for experimentation with new mechanics and quick iteration.</li>
          <li>Exploration of new engine features, such as the Gameplay Ability System (GAS) or the Enhanced Input
            System, to better support a
            larger-scale game.</li>
          <li>Leveraging existing technologies developed by Tequila to enhance the features being introduced.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The most important factor during this phase was flexibility and fast iteration, as we needed to develop a
          concept prototype on a tight schedule and explore many ideas. This meant that the initial programming
          foundation would likely be replaced later with a more stable and sustainable system for a larger team once the
          game entered full production.</p>

        <p>That said, we aimed to write high-quality code that could be reused as much as possible in later phases. This
          approach proved successful, as many of the core ideas, implementations, and adaptations from this phase were
          used as a foundation in later development, contributing to a smooth transition into full production.</p>

        <p>In addition to defining the architecture, I led a small team of 2-3 junior programmers, introducing them to
          Tequila's codebase and ensuring the quality and maintainability of their work. I was also directly involved in
          implementing several key components for the prototype, including player movement, gameplay abilities
          (for both players and NPCs), respawning systems, damage, UI, collisions, and more. Essentially, many of the
          building
          blocks for a fully functional and playable prototype.</p>

        <p>This phase of development was highly collaborative, with frequent meetings and discussions between the
          programming and design teams as we experimented with various ideas.</p>

        <h3>Production phase: Game Designer</h3>

        <p>As the game entered production, I transitioned into the role of Game Designer, where I was primarily
          responsible for the 3Cs: Character, Controller, and Camera, drawing on my experience from previous projects.
        </p>

        <p>The character design encompassed many aspects of the game, so it was divided into different gameplay loops,
          each assigned to different designers. Beyond basic character features, I was responsible for one of these
          loops, centered
          around character movement. By the time development halted, this gameplaly loop was highly regarded as one
          of the most fun and engaging aspects of the game.</p>

        <p>In my role as a Game Designer, my responsibilities often included:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Writing Game Design Documents (GDDs):</strong> These varied in length and complexity depending on
            the feature's development phase. The implementation team praised these GDDs for their clarity and detailed
            explanations, which led to efficient implementations with minimal iterations needed to achieve optimal
            results.</li>

          <li><strong>Brainstorming and Feedback Sessions:</strong> I actively participated in brainstorming sessions
            and feedback
            rounds with my design peers to generate interesting ideas, solve gameplay issues, and refine our designs. I
            was known for making significant contributions that were appreciated by both leads and teammates.</li>

          <li><strong>Showcasing Design Ideas:</strong> I created presentations, videos, documents, and prototypes to
            clearly communicate design solutions to the Lead Game Designer or Game Direction as needed.</li>

          <li><strong>Collaboration:</strong> I worked closely with other game designers, programmers, animators, and
            artists in small teams to develop specific features.</li>

          <li><strong>Adjusting and Balancing Game Parameters:</strong> My goal was to enhance the quality and feel of
            various game features through careful tuning.</li>

          <li><strong>Integrating Animations:</strong> I integrated character gameplay animations and tied them into the
            game’s logic events.</li>

          <li><strong>Creating Example Levels:</strong> These served as showcases for the potential of my assigned game
            features, demonstrating their possibilities.</li>

          <li><strong>Reviewing Work:</strong> I regularly reviewed my designs and progress
            with the assigned Lead Game Designer to ensure alignment and quality.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>In addition to the 3Cs, I was also responsible for designing various isolated features as needed, including
          specific game objects and UI elements.</p>

        <h3>Production phase: Product Owner</h3>

        <p>Shortly after the game entered production, I was assigned the co-role of Product Owner within the overall
          Agile Scrum organization. This role was chosen for me due to my communication skills, comprehensive
          understanding of the development process, and long-term vision for features and implementations.</p>

        <p>My primary objective was to maintain continuous communication with both Production and Game Direction,
          enabling me to coordinate a team comprising programmers, designers, and artists. This coordination ensured the
          quality of deliveries and their alignment with direction requirements.</p>

        <p>Thanks to my reputation for delivering high-quality implementations and designs in similar features, I was
          assigned to the team focused on player-related features. This included elements directly controlled by the
          player, such as the main character, camera, UI, among others. It was the largest team, growing to over 20
          members before combat features were split off into a separate team to maintain manageability.</p>

        <p>In more detail, my responsibilities as a Product Owner involved:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Communicating with Game Direction</strong> to understand the goals for my team's assigned features
            in the medium to long term.</li>

          <li><strong>Organizing tasks with Production</strong> broadly for each delivery cycle, ensuring that features
            met expected outcomes while adhering to budget constraints.</li>

          <li><strong>Coordinating individual tasks</strong> within the team for every sprint, fine-tuning them to align
            with overall goals.</li>

          <li><strong>Defining acceptance criteria</strong> for tasks to ensure they matched direction requirements and
            expectations.</li>

          <li><strong>Reviewing completed tasks</strong> to verify adherence to acceptance criteria, addressing
            misunderstandings as necessary.</li>

          <li><strong>Resolving team doubts</strong> about feature developments, arranging meetings with Game Direction
            when needed.</li>

          <li><strong>Adapting sprints in collaboration with Production</strong> to accommodate unexpected issues or
            development changes.</li>

          <li><strong>Communicating with other Product Owners</strong> whenever dependencies between our respective
            teams emerged.</li>

          <li><strong>Collecting and providing constructive feedback</strong> regarding team organization and processes
            to Production for process improvements.</li>

          <li><strong>Compiling progress reports</strong> on the development made by the team each sprint, sharing them
            with the rest of the studio.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Being a Product Owner was both a challenging and rewarding role that required increasing attention as the
          team and project complexity grew. Despite the challenges, the team consistently delivered high-quality
          features on time, resulting in highly sought-after content for the game.</p>
